Features
--------
* **Easily configurable device setups** â€” Create and load pseudo 'device trees' for different I/O setups with json files.
* **Tune launch parameters** â€” Right now the test launch sequence is implemented as a simple finite state machine. It can be customized and tuned in any way.
* **Clean command line interface** â€” The interactive CLI is intuitive to use and comes with useful help information and command descriptions.
* **Logging capabilities** â€” _coming soon_
* **Server integration** â€” _coming soon_

This application is the lite version of the fully-fledged [warp core](https://github.com/qhandley/warp-core). Unfortunately due to Covid-19, the warp core was never able
to be completed ðŸ˜”. It was originally a senior capstone project for OSU's Hybrid Rocket team that got cut short mid-development. Warp core lite is meant to be a stand-in 
and designed in a fashion that overcomes some of the initial pitfalls in development of early test scripts (such as lack of scalability). It is still in active development.
